## PyEvoLab: Exploring Biology and Evolution with Python

PyEvoLab is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks I've written for students and personal exploration of evolutionary dynamics. These notebooks showcase various computational models and approaches to simulate evolutionary processes using Python.

Enjoy exploring evolutionary processes with PyEvoLab and uncover some of the fascinating mechanisms that shape life's diversity!
